#  Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

##  Objective
The goal of this task is to clean and prepare raw data for Machine Learning models by handling missing values, encoding categorical data, standardizing numerical features, and removing outliers.

##  Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

##  Dataset
Titanic-Dataset.csv containing details of Titanic passengers such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival information.

##  Steps Followed
1. Imported and explored the dataset using Pandas.
2. Handled missing values by filling numeric columns with mean and categorical columns with mode.
3. Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding.
4. Standardized numerical columns using StandardScaler.
5. Visualized outliers with boxplots and removed them using the IQR method.

##  Visualizations
Boxplots for outlier detection and a correlation heatmap to show relationships between features.

##  Final Result
All missing values handled, categorical columns encoded, numerical columns standardized, and outliers cleaned. The dataset is ready for machine learning model training.
